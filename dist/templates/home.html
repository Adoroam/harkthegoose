            <p>We want to work with creative writers, struggling writers, writers who have published a hundred books, and writers who’ve never written more than a few sentences. Even if you gave up halfway through it 6 years ago. Even if it’s just a note you scribbled on a napkin once in a coffee shop.</p>
            <p>If you have an idea, a passion, or a story to tell - we can make it happen.</p>
            <p>

                    <li>Editing</li>
