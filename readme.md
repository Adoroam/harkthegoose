###How to set up
- clone to a folder 
  - ``` git clone https://github.com/Adoroam/angstrap.git ```
- install node dependencies
  - ``` npm install ```
- install bower libraries (the .bowerrc file saves the modules to dist/bow for easier linking)
  - ``` bower install ```
- update name, description, and anything else in ``` package.json/bower.json ```
- open your terminal/emulator of choice in the root directory and run gulp
  - ``` gulp ```
- now you should be able to go to ``` localhost ``` in your browser and check it out. when you save any important files, it should auto reload in the browser

###File locations
- ``` dist ``` main files for the website
  - ``` dist/bow ``` bower libraries
  - ``` dist/templates ``` individual templates for your views and navigation
  - ``` dist/all.min.js ``` concat/minified javascript/compiled javascript
  - ``` dist/style.css ``` concat css
- ``` node_modules ``` gulp and server stuff
- ``` src ``` places to put your custom libraries
  - ``` src/css ``` put css files here
    - ``` src/css/style.css ``` starter css file to use the raleway google font and get rid of stupid blue underlines.
  - ``` src/js ``` put javascript files here
    - ``` src/js/app.js ``` angular app with required ngRoute
    - ``` src/js/routing.js ``` routing and navigation info
  - ``` src/ts ``` put typescript files here (they will be converted to javascript and merged into dist/all.min.js by gulp)
